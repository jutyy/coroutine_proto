# coroutine_proto
Welcome to coroutine_proto! It provides a stackless coroutine library. The lightest(but enough in most cases) coroutine is of 3 pointer size!

We recommend https://github.com/yuanzhubi/cort_proto that provides industry style library for your work instead. It enables "encapsulation"!
